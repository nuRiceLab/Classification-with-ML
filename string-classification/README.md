# String classification
- The purpose of this task is to develop a machine learning model to classify medical terms 
- The medical terms are extracted from DICOM files of anonymous cancer patients 
- The file "Clustering+Preliminary Classification" is the first file in task and its content include: 
  1. Inputting raw data
  2. Data preprocessing and data cleaning
  3. Clustering
  4. Visualization of clutering results through wordcloud
  5. Manual labeling
  6. The first onehot encoding method for word embedding
  7. Training a simple classification model with five categories
  8. Evaluation of model performance through loss plots, accuracy plots, confusion matrices, probability distribution
- The file "More Classification" is a continuation of the second file and its content include:
  1. A more efficient labeling with the help of the simple classification model
  2. The second onehot encoding method for word embedding
  3. Training classification models on both encoding methods with more data, ten categories, overfitting fixed
  4. Evaluation of model performance through loss plots, accuracy plots, confusion matrices, probability distribution
- The file "EditDistance" is a non-machine learning way to classify strings by using edit-distance method
- Raw data files are 'SampleData_1500.txt' and 'SampleData_1500.txt'
